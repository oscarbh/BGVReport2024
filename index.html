                <p><b>Dear Friends,</b></p>
                <p>
                  Thank you for an incredible year at BGV. In 2024 we welcomed students back to Charles F. Hayden School
                  and watched the seniors graduate. There were delicious meals cooked by Chef Billy's culinary students
                  and visits from Breeze, our official therapy dog. You helped the children of BGV celebrate a joyous
                  holiday season and you provided candy and treats for Halloween and Easter. Your support made it
                  possible for BGV to offer the children and families it serves the care and respect they deserve.
                  Thanks to you, hundreds of staff were trained in new therapies to help children suffering from trauma,
                  and youth in our residences were able to receive the clothes and products that would make them feel at
                  home.
                </p>

              <p>
                This past year marks another exciting chapter of growth for BGV. In response to the evolving needs of
                the communities we serve, we expanded our programming to better support the whole family because we know
                that lasting change happens when we work with both children and the adults who shape their lives. As a
                result, we introduced three new programs that address the crucial role parents play in their children's
                development.
              </p>
              <p>
                These new initiatives, described below, focus on the family as a whole and help BGV work holistically to
                open new pathways out of crisis and toward a successful future.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thank you for helping the children and families of Connecticut and thank you for being a part of this
                mission with us.

              <p>The Kraft House psychiatric residential treatment program reached its milestone in April 2024, and
                although the year was not without its challenges, we feel inspired that 26 boys have received treatment
                so far! Our residential leadership team has worked diligently on providing educational training sessions
                to the client's parents that include Motivational Interviewing, meditation & mindfulness sessions, and
                assisting with finding community resources after a client's discharge.</p>

                Peter Zezima were deemed 2024 Volunteers of the Year by the Charles F. Hayden School. Breeze is more
                than just a therapy dog, Breeze gives hope, comfort, joy, and unconditional love to our school students.
                Thank you from the bottom of our hearts to Peter for his over ten years of volunteerism at BGV and for
                sharing his family with us. Peter and Breeze make the world a brighter place.</p>

          <p>When Maria first connected with Boys & Girls Village, things were unraveling. "I was drinking alcohol and
            had a seizure," she recalls. "I went to the hospital, and the social worker called DCF on me. Then DCF
            referred me to BGV." That moment marked the beginning of one her greatest challenges, staying sober and
            finding a person to help who she felt connected to. "Then MST-BSF came in and I really liked them. I was
            able to find my way with them."</p>
          <p>Through the program, Maria didn't just stop drinking. "I learned how to create boundaries with people," she
            says. "I stayed sober, and I learned how to deal with situations in a different way than I used to."</p>
          <p>What stands out most was how connected she felt to her MST-BSF team</p>
          <p>"Staying sober and taking care of my son." This is Maria's definition of success.</p>
